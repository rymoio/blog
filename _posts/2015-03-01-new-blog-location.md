I recently decided to move my blog to a new domain. I've decided to use my [rymo.io][personal] domain in place of my [ryancmorrissey.com][professional] domain. Both domains will remain active, however I'm transitioning my older domain to serve as a professional landing page and resume. I'll be working on redirecting all my old posts to this domain, which shouldn't take too long (although I really hate dealing with `.htaccess` files). Meanwhile, enjoy the new site and layout!

[personal]: https://rymo.io/
[professional]: http://ryancmorrissey.com/
